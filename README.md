# applied--game-theory-for-agency
Game theory- based models of agency. I want to develop a platform which gathers useful applications of game theory for issues like
incentives, team coordination, psychological biases, intrinsic motivation etc.

I would like to devote much of the effort in writing useful programs in R, sympy, mathematica etc.
